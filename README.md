## Hi, I am Kamil ðŸ¤—
I am learning Python at the moment. In my free time I am engaged at the Clanhouse as Marketing Manager and Tester at the moment. My goal is to automate testing using PyTest and Selenium and create tests schema. In the future I am going to go deeper into back-end or cyber-security testing.

### I work as Product Manager. ###
As a Product Manager in Malow (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamil-marchel/), I usually work on the use of leverage in sales in various distribution channels. I take care of the completeness of the offer and product development by conducting market research, competition analysis and the design of new functions and product improvements. I manage a product category, conduct market and competition analyzes, and follow trends. I conduct internal trainings, including the sales department. I take care of the brand image, create and supervise marketing campaigns.
