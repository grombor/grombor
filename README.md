## Hi, I am Kamil 🤗

I am currently working on two projects simultaneously. The first one is a web scraper written in Python, which allows me to gather data from various websites. The second project is an e-commerce project where I am writing code in ReactJS. This allows me to develop skills in both backend and frontend development.

I have experience in creating responsive user interfaces and working with tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am dedicated and eager to learn new technologies. My goal is to continuously improve as a developer and contribute my skills to the development of innovative projects.

I am seeking a Junior Web Developer position utilizing the ReactJS framework. If you are looking for a candidate who is ready to take on challenges, possesses technical skills, and has a strong desire for growth, then I am the right person to talk to!

### I work as Product Manager.

As a Product Manager in Malow (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamil-marchel/), I usually work on the use of leverage in sales in various distribution channels. I take care of the completeness of the offer and product development by conducting market research, competition analysis and the design of new functions and product improvements. I manage a product category, conduct market and competition analyzes, and follow trends. I conduct internal trainings, including the sales department. I take care of the brand image, create and supervise marketing campaigns.
